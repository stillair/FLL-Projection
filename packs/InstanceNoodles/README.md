# InstanceNoodles
Alpha 0.4 Tsukemen

Instance Noodles is a modular patching system for Compute & Geometry shaders in DX11/vvvv. Inspired by the fast & pleasant workflow in stock vvvv this lib aims to bring the same visual flow programming approach to GPGPU calculations & procedural geometry manipulation.

In 0.4 there are some new nodes, eg Subdivision (DX11.GeomFX), compute Zips, a nice LineBuffered(DX11.Layer) module (courtesy of Dávid “Microdee” Morass) and some general improvements such as adding a (hidden) thread group size pin and modernizing the default group size to 128 on all compute nodes.  +Quite a few other bits & bobs I’m too lazy to list.  Note that the pack now depends on ‘happy.fxh’ to be next to it in /packs in order to work.

Requires 

  •vvvv >= 35.7 + Addon Pack
  
  •DX11 pack >= 1.1
  
  •https://github.com/everyoneishappy/happy.fxh
  
  •a GPU that supports Shader Model 5
